# OIBSIP_Java_Development_Task - Simple Login System

# Objective
To develop a **simple console-based login system** using Java, which includes:
- User registration
- Login authentication
- Access to a secured page after login



# Steps Performed
1. Initialized a `HashMap` to store username-password pairs.
2. Created a menu with options: Register, Login, Access Secured Page, and Exit.
3. Implemented logic for:
   - Registering new users with unique usernames.
   - Validating login credentials.
   - Granting access to a protected section only if the user is logged in.
4. Added condition checks and appropriate messages for user experience.



# Tools Used
- **Java (JDK)** – Core programming language  
- **Scanner Class** – For input handling  
- **HashMap** – For storing user credentials  
-  VS Code (any Java-supporting IDE)



# Outcome
- Successfully built a console-based secure login system.
- Users can:
  - Register once with a unique username.
  - Login with valid credentials.
  - Access a protected section only after successful login.
- Basic structure ready for expansion to file-based or GUI-based login systems.
